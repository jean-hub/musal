Prototype of the augmented Lagrangian based real-time NMPC algorithm.
This is C++ code based on the algorithms described in the following papers:
- "A Parametric Non-Convex Decomposition Algorithm for Distributed and Real-Time NMPC" by J.-H. Hours and C.N. Jones,
IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2016
- "A Parametric Augmented Lagrangian Algorithm for Real-Time Economic NMPC", by J.-H. Hours, H. Shukla and C.N. Jones,
European Control Conference 2016
- "An Alternating Trust Region Algorithm for Distributed Linearly Constrained Nonlinear Programs, Application to the AC Optimal Power Flow" by J.-H. Hours and C.N. Jones, Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, to appear.
